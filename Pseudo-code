Enter all five numbers into an array
Prompt user to enter the five numbers (use Trap x23) Where does Trap x23 send values to?
	Store all the values
STR all values (base case address + 4 more addresses)

1.	Go through each index to determine the minimum and the max
Loop through the array until the minimum is found by …
Loop through the array until the maximum is found by…
2.	Calculate the average of the five numbers
Go to addresses of where the five numbers were stored and average the five numbers
Store the value of the average in a new location
Access the value of the average and output it to the console
Associate the value of the average to an actual letter grade by connecting the scale to a letter
3.	Output the grade
